# CPU Scheduler Simulation Program

This program simulates the behavior of different CPU scheduling algorithms in operating systems. It allows users to simulate scheduling algorithms such as First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling, Round Robin (RR), and Priority Scheduling with Round Robin. Users can customize simulation parameters and visualize the scheduling process, as well as compare the performance of different algorithms.

## Introduction
This program is developed as an assignment to deepen understanding of CPU scheduling algorithms and their impact on system performance in operating systems. It implements various scheduling algorithms and provides a user-friendly interface for simulation and analysis.

## Features
- Implementation of FCFS, SJF, Priority Scheduling, RR, and Priority Scheduling with RR algorithms.
- Generation of random processes or reading processes from a file.
- Calculation of performance metrics such as average turnaround time, average waiting time, and CPU utilization.
- Visualization of the scheduling process, including process order, remaining burst time, turnaround time, and waiting time.
- User interaction for customizing simulation parameters and choosing scheduling algorithms.
- Documentation and comments for code clarity and understanding.

## Installation
To run the program, ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository:
   https://github.com/OUM124/CPU-Scheduler-Simulation.git
2. Compile the Java files:
javac *.java


3. Run the program:
java Main


## Usage
Upon running the program, follow the prompts to select simulation parameters and scheduling algorithms. The program will display the scheduling process and performance metrics based on the chosen parameters and algorithms.

## Customization
You can customize the simulation by adjusting parameters such as the number of processes, burst time range, arrival time range, and selecting different scheduling algorithms.

## Performance Metrics
The program calculates performance metrics including average turnaround time, average waiting time, and CPU utilization for each scheduling algorithm. These metrics are displayed after the simulation completes.

## Visualization
The program provides visualization of the scheduling process through textual representation. It displays information such as the order of scheduled processes, remaining burst time, turnaround time, and waiting time.
